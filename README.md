All of these screens are interchangeable between light and dark themes.  

The current state of my application functions as a tracker for a fantasy football lineup. You can add and remove players from your lineup manually. You can also add two players and their stats to the trade analyzer to see if you are making a good trade. There is also a light/dark theme toggle and a date/time picker that shows what week you are in. In terms of data storage, your lineup is updated and saved as you add and remove players. It does not save anything else at the moment.  

If I had more time, I would integrate a network API to fetch player stats in real time. This would remove the need to manually add player stats every week. If I had access to live stats, I would add a leaderboard for each position to show who the top performers for each week were. I would also add some depth to the trade analyzer, as it only takes basic stats into consideration. Lastly, I would make it possible to save more of the app (theme toggle and maybe some trades).
